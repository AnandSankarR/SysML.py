 This project is intended to provide an object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm for practicing [Model-Based Systems Engineering](https://www.incose.org/docs/default-source/delaware-valley/mbse-overview-incose-30-july-2015.pdf) (MBSE).

## Package Contents

- `sysml/system.py` - module for creating a `Model` object, which serves as a central namespace for model elements (and relationships between elements).

- `sysml/element.py` - module for creating model elements (s.a., `Package`, `Block`, `Requirement`, `Activity`, etc.). These objects are intended to be subsumed by a `Model` object, using a composite design pattern.

- `sysml/parser.py` - module for serializing/deserializing `Model` objects.

## Developer Notes

This project is still in pre-alpha. For a more detailed overview on design, usage, and features, please refer to
[#1](https://github.com/spacedecentral/SysML.py/issues/1).

Optional (but recommended for viewing GitHub issues): Install the [ZenHub for GitHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd?hl=en-US) chrome extension.

### Development Pipeline

The following semantic version names and corresponding features are being considered for the current development pipeline for `SysML.py`:

- `0.x.y` - standalone python package for SysML (coming soon to PyPI)
- `1.x.y` - to include a full profile implementation of the current SysML ([v1.5](https://sysml.org/docs/specs/OMGSysML-v1.5-17-05-01.pdf)) specification
- `2.x.y` - to include a full profile implementation of the upcoming SysML ([v2.0](https://www.phoenix-int.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Phx2018UC_KEYNOTE_Friedenthal.pdf)) specification
