**SysML.py** is an open source, Apache-licensed library providing a [Python](https://www.python.org) implementation of the [Systems Modeling Language](https://sysml.org) (SysML) for practicing [Model-Based Systems Engineering](https://www.incose.org/docs/default-source/delaware-valley/mbse-overview-incose-30-july-2015.pdf) (MBSE).

## Package Contents

- `sysml/system.py` - module for creating a `Model` object, which serves as a central namespace for model elements (and relationships between elements).

- `sysml/element.py` - module for creating model elements (s.a., `Package`, `Block`, `ConstraintBlock`, `Activity`, `Interaction`, `StateMachine`, `Requirement`). These objects are intended to be subsumed by a `Model` object.

## Developer Notes

This project is still in pre-alpha. For a more detailed overview on design, usage, and features, please refer to
[Design considerations for initial package release](https://github.com/spacedecentral/SysML.py/issues/1).

### Development Pipeline

The following [semver](https://semver.org/) releases are being considered for the development pipeline for SysML.py:

- `0.x.y` - a standalone python implementation of SysML
- `1.x.y` - a full profile implementation of the current SysML ([v1.5](https://sysml.org/docs/specs/OMGSysML-v1.5-17-05-01.pdf)) specification
- `2.x.y` - a full profile implementation of the upcoming SysML ([v2.0](https://www.phoenix-int.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Phx2018UC_KEYNOTE_Friedenthal.pdf)) specification
