# This YAML file contains a SysML model sample template of the hypothetical FireSat mission.

# The intent of this template is to provide a lightweight human-readable data
# serialization format for describing a SysML model.
# The SysML model consists of model elements and relationshipts, wherein model elements
# are treated as a list of nodes and model relations are treated as a list of edges.

# YAML can be validated using https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator
# (WIP): A schema will be used to validate whether a YAML file is also a valid SysML model
# (WIP): a complementary python api will be provided for generating the 9 SysML diagrams from this template.

# Notes: labels and id_no's must be unique per stereotype
