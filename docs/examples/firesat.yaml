# This YAML file contains a SysML model sample template of the hypothetical FireSat mission.

# The intent of this template is to provide a lightweight human-readable data
# serialization format for describing a SysML model.
# The SysML model consists of model elements and relationshipts, wherein model elements
# are treated as a list of nodes and model relations are treated as a list of edges.

# YAML can be validated using https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator
# More info on yaml syntax and usage can be found here:
# https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/
# (WIP): A schema will be used to validate whether a YAML file is also a valid SysML model
# (WIP): a complementary python api will be provided for generating the 9 SysML diagrams from this template.

# Notes: labels and id_no's must be unique per stereotype

Description: A SysML model sample template for the hypothetical FireSat mission

elements: # model elements are treated as a dictionary of nodes
# An alternative design paradigm may be to nest key-value pairs such that labels
# are sorted under their respective stereotype. Note: such an approach means the
# stereotype context is lost when defining relationships between model elements
    package-1: #  FireSat mission requirements are contained within a package
        label: FireSat Mission requirements
    package-2: # functional requirements define how well the system must perform to meet its objectives
