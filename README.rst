============================
 SysMLpy
============================

A Python package for SysML (systems modeling language) - a general purpose modeling language that supports analysis, design, and verification of complex systems.

The design intent of this project is to serve as an interoperable and extensible object-oriented programming (OOP) toolkit, using the SysML (currently, v1.4) specification as the core modeling framework, for enabling model-based systems engineering.
