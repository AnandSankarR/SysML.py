============================
 SysMLpy
============================

A Python package for SysML (systems modeling language) - a general purpose modeling language that supports analysis, design, and verification of complex systems.

The design intent of this project is to provide an object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm for reading, appending, editing, and removing model attributes in SysML models, as well as integrating simulation and data visualization capability using python supported packages, for model-based systems engineering.
